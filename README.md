# Mercari Euro Hack 2018 - e1337 Team

## Idea
Nowadays sharing economy services offer us more comfortable, eco-friendly and satisfying life. 

However, when you want to join one of the communities you might find it difficult to convince people to trust you.
It also works the other way round; when you want to find someone to babysit your child, rent an apartment from for a few days or walk your dog you do not want to ask a random, unknown person. 

We want to change that!

Our goal is to make sharing economy users look trustworthy from the beggining of their new adventure.
To achieve this we will enable them to use their reviews from other sources, like Uber, Ebay and other sharing economy services.
That will provide us with enough data to display for each user as Uber itself has over 1.5 milion drivers.
To make our product more reliable we want to use blockchain so that the data is kept safe and transparent.

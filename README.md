## Idea
Nowadays, there are more and more sharing economy companies. Furthermore, fast growing companies like Mercari is expanding to new markets. In those new markets, Mercari doesn't have any users with ratings. They need to sell or buy something in order to get reviews and become trustworthy. That slows conquering new markets.

For another example, when you want to find someone to babysit your child, rent an apartment from for a few days or walk your dog you do not want to ask a random, unknown person. But a person with ratings from other services like Uber (which itself has over 1.5 million drivers) is much more trustworthy than a person without any ratings.

Our goal is to make sharing economy users look trustworthy from the beggining of their new adventure.

We will be using AWS for highly scalable, available, reliable, and fast solution. To make our product more reliable we want to use blockchain so that the data is kept safe and transparent.

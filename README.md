### Problem

Nowadays, there are more and more sharing economy companies. Furthermore, fast growing companies like Mercari are expanding to new markets. In those new markets, Mercari doesn't have any users with ratings. The consumers need to sell or buy something in order to get reviews and become trustworthy. That slows conquering new markets.

For another example, when you want to find someone to babysit your child, rent an apartment from for a few days or walk your dog you do not want to ask a random, unknown person.

### Solution

Our goal is to make sharing economy users look trustworthy from the beggining of their new adventure. To achieve this we will enable them to use their reviews from other sharing economy platforms, like Ebay, Uber or Allegro. That will provide us with enough data to display for each user as Uber itself has over 1.5 milion drivers. These combined ratings will be available to our consumers via API or web widgets.

We will be using AWS for highly scalable, available, reliable, and fast solution. To make our product more reliable we will  use blockchain so that the data is kept safe and transparent.
